# Publicly Open Mapping Files

POMF is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Minecraft freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.

The current version targets Minecraft version **1.13.2-pre2**.

## Contributing

Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP) is **completely forbidden** without explicit permission from the 
owners of said mappings. It is also good to consult name changes with other people - use pull requests or our IRC (#fabric @ irc.esper.net) to ask questions!

WIP mapping guidelines are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15fHL-WgK0uMPAy-WJbQtxrfOVLJNlfasjsnt_wruOXA/edit). Feel free to contribute.
